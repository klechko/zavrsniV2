  <note>The Comedy Pet Photography Awards 2020Elke Vogelsang31137 HildesheimGermanyPhone: Email: Title: &quot;SQUIRRELLL!!!&quot;Description: Noodles was rescued from a Spanish kill-shelter and brought to Germany, where she joined our family when she was eight months old. She is a Spanish sighthound (Galgo EspaÃ±ol) mix, 13 years old now (a bit younger in this picture) and still acting like a pup. She is the clown, sometimes overly motivated and clumsy, the eager-beaver, curious, friendly, open-minded, extremely funny if not unintentionally comic sometimes.Animal: Noodles, Spanish rescue mixLocation of shot: Hildesheim, Germany</note>
